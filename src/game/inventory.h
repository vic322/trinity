    // Inventory browser / editor. See offsets.h (kSig_InvCoreGlobal,
    // kSig_InvGetItemQty, kSig_InvGetHolder, kStr_ItemInfoTable) for the RE
    // background: the live item holder is resolved primarily by a pure
    // pointer walk from the core global singleton (works from load), with a
    // hook on the HUD's item-count accessor as a second capture path.
    //
    // Item names AND category names are the game's OWN localised text, read
    // live (kSig_LocStringGet) rather than from any baked-in table, so they
    // match the installed version and the player's language. Grouping is the
    // game's own too: each item lists the "ItemGroupInfo" rows it belongs to,
    // and the one the inventory displays is picked by _orderIndex - the same
    // categories and order the game's own tabs use ("Ranged Weapon", "Elixir",
    // "Crafting and Refinement Material"). Icons likewise: both items and
    // categories name their sprite through the "stringinfo" table. Nothing
    // about any of it is hardcoded.
    //
    // The snapshot is STORAGE -> category -> item. The outer level is real: one
    // holder holds every storage you own (your pack, Private Storage, Wardrobe,
    // the Bank, the Kuku Cooler...), one bucket each, and each bucket names
    // itself via bucket+0x10 -> the "InventoryInfo" table (see offsets.h). Its
    // names are the game's own localised ones, like everything else here.
    // Before this split the levels were merged, so a stack in the Bank and one
    // in your pack appeared as two identical rows with no way to tell them
    // apart - and editing one silently touched a storage you were not looking
    // at.
    //
    // Editing a quantity writes the slot in BOTH the client mirror and the
    // server-authority holder - writing only the client reverts, because a
    // per-frame server reconcile overwrites it. The server holder is learned
    // from the transaction-commit hook (kSig_InvCommit), which sees it during
    // the save load itself; see that signature's comment for why it must be
    // that hook, and why the capture must not be filtered at capture time.
